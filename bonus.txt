Bonus Features:

1. Html Error pages for each error. The error pages are designed like every modern web server. 
2. Extending the config.ini file that gives the user the ability to custom the default error pages.
	for doing so the user should do the following: 
	1. Create error pages under the root directory (can be also under directories inside the root)
	2. In the config file add the following fields in the exact order (the order matter but no file is mandatory) : 
		bad-request= [file path]
		not-found= [file path]
		internal= [file path]
		not-implemented= [file path]

3. Dynamic html generator for post request only (can be extended easily to support also get requests).
	the Generator works that way: 
		1. Assuming the post request contains field with name "message" and value "my message". 
		2. Assuming the developer of the html would like to get the value of the message in a div element.
		3. The developer should add <div>@{message}</div>
		4. Then when generating the html the server will change the value of the div to the value of the messsage.
		5. The result html will be: <div>my message</div>
